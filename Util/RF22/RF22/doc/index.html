<h1>RF22 library for Arduino</h1>
<p>
This is the Arduino <a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a> library. It provides an object-oriented interface for sending and receiving data messages with Hope-RF RF22B based radio modules, and compatible chips and modules, including the RFM22B transceiver module such as this one: <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10153">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10153</a><p>
<a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a> also supports some of the features of ZigBee and XBee, (such as mesh routing and automatic route discovery), but with a much less complicated system and less expensive radios.<p>
The Hope-RF (<a href="http://www.hoperf.com">http://www.hoperf.com</a>) RFM22B (<a href="http://www.hoperf.com/rf_fsk/fsk/RFM22B.htm">http://www.hoperf.com/rf_fsk/fsk/RFM22B.htm</a>) is a low-cost ISM transceiver module. It supports FSK, GFSK, OOK over a wide range of frequencies and programmable data rates.<p>
This library provides functions for sending and receiving messages of up to 255 octets on any frequency supported by the RF22B, in a range of predefined data rates and frequency deviations. Frequency can be set with 312Hz precision to any frequency from 240.0MHz to 960.0MHz.<p>
Up to 2 RF22B modules can be connected to an Arduino, permitting the construction of translators and frequency changers, etc.<p>
This library provides classes for<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a>: unaddressed, unreliable messages</li><li><a class="el" href="classRF22Datagram.html" title="RF22 subclass for addressed, unreliable messages.">RF22Datagram</a>: addressed, unreliable messages</li><li><a class="el" href="classRF22ReliableDatagram.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, acknowledged, retransmitted datagrams.">RF22ReliableDatagram</a>: addressed, reliable, retransmitted, acknowledged messages.</li><li><a class="el" href="classRF22Router.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Router</a>: multi hop delivery from source node to destination node via 0 or more intermediate nodes</li><li><a class="el" href="classRF22Mesh.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Mesh</a>: multi hop delivery with automatic route discovery and rediscovery.</li></ul>
<p>
The following modulation types are suppported with a range of modem configurations for common data rates and frequency deviations:<ul>
<li>GFSK Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying</li><li>FSK Frequency Shift Keying</li><li>OOK On-Off Keying</li></ul>
<p>
Support for other RF22B features such as on-chip temperature measurement, analog-digital converter, transmitter power control etc is also provided.<p>

Tested on Arduino Diecimila and Mega with arduino-0021 on OpenSuSE 11.1 and avr-libc-1.6.1-1.15, cross-avr-binutils-2.19-9.1, cross-avr-gcc-4.1.3_20080612-26.5. With HopeRF RFM22 modules that appear to have RF22B chips on board:<ul>
<li>Device Type Code = 0x08 (RX/TRX)</li><li>Version Code = 0x06 It is known not to work on Diecimila. Dont bother trying.</li></ul>
<p>
<dl class="user" compact><dt><b>Packet Format</b></dt><dd></dd></dl>
All messages sent and received by this <a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a> library must conform to this packet format:<p>
<ul>
<li>8 nibbles (4 octets) PREAMBLE</li><li>2 octets SYNC 0x2d, 0xd4</li><li>4 octets HEADER: (TO, FROM, ID, FLAGS)</li><li>1 octet LENGTH (0 to 255), number of octets in DATA</li><li>0 to 255 octets DATA</li><li>2 octets CRC computed with CRC16(IBM), computed on HEADER, LENGTH and DATA</li></ul>
<p>
For technical reasons, the message format is not compatible with the 'HopeRF Radio Transceiver Message Library for Arduino' <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/HopeRF">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/HopeRF</a> from the same author. Nor is it compatible with 'Virtual Wire' <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire.pdf">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire.pdf</a> also from the same author.<p>
<dl class="user" compact><dt><b>Connecting RFM-22 to Arduino</b></dt><dd>The physical connection between the RF22B and the Arduino require 3.3V, the 3 x SPI pins (SCK, SDI, SDO), a Slave Select pin and an interrupt pin. Note also that on the RFF22B, it is required to control the TX_ANT and X_ANT pins of the RFM22 in order to enable the antenna connection. The <a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a> library is configured so that GPIO0 and GPIO1 outputs can control TX_ANT and RX_ANT input pins automatically. You must connect GPIO0 to TX_ANT and GPIO1 to RX_ANT for this automatic antenna switching to occur.</dd></dl>
Connect the RFM-22 to most Arduino's like this (Caution, Arduino Mega has different pins for SPI, see below): <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">                 Arduino      RFM-22B

</pre></div> and you can then use the default constructor RF22(). You can override the default settings for the SS pin and the interrupt in the <a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a> constructor if you wish to connect the slave select SS to other than pin D10 or the interrupt request to other than pin D2. It is possible to have 2 radios conected to one arduino, provided each radio has its own SS and interrupt line (SCK, SDI and SDO are common to both radios)<p>

<dl class="user" compact><dt><b>Memory</b></dt><dd></dd></dl>
The <a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a> library requires non-trivial amounts of memory. The sample programs above all compile to about 9 to 14kbytes each, which will fit in the flash proram memory of most Arduinos. However, the RAM requirements are more critical. Most sample programs above will run on Duemilanova, but not on Diecimila. Even on Duemilanova, the RAM requirements are very close to the available memory of 2kbytes. Therefore, you should be vary sparing with RAM use in programs that use the <a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a> library on Duemilanova.<p>
The sample <a class="el" href="classRF22Router.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Router</a> and <a class="el" href="classRF22Mesh.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Mesh</a> programs compile to about 14kbytes, and require more RAM than the others. They will not run on Duemilanova or Diecimila, but will run on Arduino Mega.<p>
It is often hard to accurately identify when you are hitting RAM limits on Arduino. The symptoms can include:<ul>
<li>Mysterious crashes and restarts</li><li>Changes in behaviour when seemingly unrelated changes are made (such as adding print() statements)</li><li>Hanging</li><li>Output from Serial.print() not appearing</li></ul>
<p>
With an Arduino Mega, with 8 kbytes of SRAM, there is much more RAM headroom for your own elaborate programs. This library is reported not to work with Arduino Pro Mini and Arduino UNO, but these have not been tested here.<p>

<dl class="user" compact><dt><b>Revision History</b></dt><dd></dd></dl>
<dl class="version" compact><dt><b>Version:</b></dt><dd>1.0 Initial release<p>
1.1 Added rf22_snoop and rf22_specan examples<p>
1.2 Changed default modulation to FSK_Rb2_4Fd36 Some internal reorganisation. Added <a class="el" href="classRF22Router.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Router</a> and <a class="el" href="classRF22Mesh.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Mesh</a> classes plus sample programs to support multi-hop and automatic route discovery. <p>
1.3 Removed some unnecessary debug messages. Added virtual doArp and isPhysicalAddress functions to <a class="el" href="classRF22Mesh.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Mesh</a> to support other physical address interpretation schemes (IPV4/IPV6?) <p>
1.4 <a class="el" href="classRF22Router.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Router</a> and <a class="el" href="classRF22Mesh.html" title="RF22 subclass for sending addressed, optionally acknowledged datagrams multi-hop...">RF22Mesh</a> were inadvertently left out of the distro. <p>
1.5 Improvements contributed by Peter Mousley: Modem config table is now in flash rather than SRAM, saving 400 bytes of SRAM. Allow a user-defined buffer size. Thanks Peter. <p>
1.6 Fixed some minor typos on doc and clarified that this code is for the RF22B. Fixed errors in the definition of the power output constants which were incorrectly set to the values for the <a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a>. Reported by Fred Slamen. If you were using a previous version of <a class="el" href="classRF22.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams.">RF22</a>, you probably were not getting the output power you thought. <p>
1.7 Added code to initialise GPIO0 and GPIO1 so they can automatically control the TX_ANT and RX_ANT antenna switching inputs. You must connect GPIO0 to TX_ANT and GPIO1 to RX_ANT for this automatic antenna switching to occur. Updated doc to reflect this new connection requirement <p>
1.8 Changed the name of RF22_ENLBD in RF22_REG_06_INTERRUPT_ENABLE2 to RF22_ENLBDI because it collided with a define of the same name in RF22_REG_07_OPERATING_MODE. RF22_REG_05_INTERRUPT_ENABLE1 enable mask incorrectly used RF22_IFFERROR instead of RF22_ENFFERR. Reported by Steffan Woltjer. <p>
1.9 Fixed typos in RF22_REG_21_CLOCk*. Reported by Steffan Woltjer.</dd></dl>
